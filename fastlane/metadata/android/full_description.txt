nymea transforms your regular smart devices into a harmoniously connected ecosystem.

The uses for nymea are broad, varying from a powerful smart home to connect individual things and remotely control them.

All it takes is to set up nymea in your network, e.g. by copying the nymea image to a Raspberry Pi or installing it on any other Linux powered computer in your network, and use nymea:app to easily connect all your devices and services.

While being fully open source, nymea respects the users privacy and keeps on working even without internet connection by following an offline first approach.
