  <h3>2. Interaction with products from other providers</h3>
  <p>The “maveo” products are designed for interaction and integration with products of other providers. This applies in particular to products based on the ZigBee specification (Philips Hue for example). When a connection is established with such products, “maveo” only provides the access data required to establish the connection.</p>
  <p>We have no influence on the processing of personal data by third-party providers of such products. Please consult the data protection guideline of the respective third party in this regard.</p>
  <h3>3. Use and dissemination of data</h3>
  <p>Personal data are used and disseminated exclusively for the purpose of operating and maintaining the “maveo” products.</p>
  <h4>3.1. Operation of the “maveo” products</h4>
  <p>The personal data listed below are used as follows for the operation of the “maveo” products:</p>
  <p><b>WiFi access data:</b><br>WiFi access data are recorded for the integration of the “maveo” box in a WLAN and stored in the “maveo” box.</p>
  <p><b>E-mail address/password:</b><br>A user has to be set up to use the “maveo” box. This requires the user to enter his or her e-mail address one time as well as a password chosen by the user. Both are stored in the device and in the control app.</p>
  <p><b>Bluetooth pairing information:</b><br>To establish connections between the mobile unit and “maveo” box, and between the “maveo” stick/“maveo” sensor and the “maveo” box, pairing information is exchanged and stored in the “maveo” box for subsequent connections.</p>
  <p><b>ZigBee control data:</b><br>To establish and maintain a connection with ZigBee devices (Philips Hue for example), control data are exchanged and stored in the “maveo” box.</br>
  <p><b>SnapStore:</b><br>There is no use of personal data.</p>
  <p><b>Certificate/CPU serial number:</b><br>To connect to the guh-cloud, a certificate preconfigured in the “maveo” box and the CPU serial number are transmitted. The guh-cloud is required for remote access, push notifications, and other services that have not been implemented yet. Possible services include paid weather services, camera streams, and SMS services.</p>
  <p><b>Device information:</b><br>To assist with problems, “maveo” can grant the user the option to connect his or her device with a help desk server, thereby giving help desk personnel full access to the device and the data stored on it for a predefined period of time; the connection is severed automatically. Passwords are not transmitted or displayed.</p>
  <p><b>Crash information:</b><br>The “maveo” box and the “maveo” app can provide functionality that, in case of a crash, automatically generates and sends a report describing when and why the crash occurred. No personal data are involved here.</p>
  <h4>3.2. Other processing of data</h4>
  <p>We use the personal data to optimize the delivery of services, including remote diagnosis of malfunctions and fault elimination if applicable. Data stored for this purpose are located on servers in the EU and are protected against unauthorized access using state-of-the-art, established security measures.</p>
  <p>We also used state-of-the-art, established methods to protect the transmission of information from your home network over the Internet to our servers and from our servers to your home network.</p>
  <p>There is no dissemination of personal data for promotional or marketing purposes. Personal data are only disseminated in the following cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To the suppliers and service providers used by us in order to provide services contractually agreed with you, and/or to provide services requested by you</li>
    <li>Upon transferring the company or “maveo” business area to a third party, wherein the third party is obligated to handle the data exclusively according to the data privacy statement applicable for you</li>
