License

nymea software and libraries are provided under a dual license model designed
to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors
(such as OEMs and VARs) and open source projects.

===============================================================================

Commercial License

With the commercial license you can combine and distribute your software with
nymea for any commercial purpose without the implications of the open-sources
on nymea code.

Please keep in mind, that nymea is based on the Qt framework and thus requires
a valid Qt license.

The nymea commercial license comes with additional tools and services to make
a developers life easier. You can download the terms and conditions here.

Please contact contact@nymea.io for further details.

===============================================================================

Open-Source License

We are dedicated to open-source and free software, that's why we open-source'd
nymea:core, nymea:app and a number of nymea Plug-ins and other tools.

nymea is licensed under “GPLv3”. You can use nymea for free as long as your
application is compliant to GPLv3.

nymea Plug-ins are typically published under the LGPLv3. Please verify the
license of each Plug-in in the license header of the respective source files:
http://www.github.com/nymea/nymea-plugins

If you consider to create commercial products based on open-source licenses,
we advise to check for any legal implications.
